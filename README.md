# Landru

## Introduction

Landru is a repository housing the codebase for creating and training a machine learning model that utilizes traffic simulation data for large-scale traffic optimization. The primary objectives of this project are to understand traffic patterns, predict traffic conditions, and optimize traffic flow through the application of reinforcement learning techniques on virtual traffic networks.

## Goals

The overarching goals of Landru include:

1. **Understanding Traffic Patterns**: Analyzing simulated traffic flow to gain insights into vehicle behavior, congestion dynamics, and potential bottlenecks.

2. **Predicting Traffic Conditions**: Developing a trained model capable of forecasting future traffic states, allowing for proactive management and mitigation of congestion.

3. **Optimizing Traffic Flow**: Utilizing the model's insights to design and evaluate strategies for optimizing traffic signal timing, route planning, and infrastructure improvements.

## Approach

The Landru project employs the following approach:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering simulated traffic data from UXSIM repository.

2. **Model Training**: Training a machine learning model using reinforcement learning techniques to understand and predict traffic patterns.

3. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance in predicting traffic conditions and optimizing traffic flow through simulation-based experiments.

4. **Deployment**: Integrating the trained model into real-world traffic management systems for practical applications.
