A large-scale traffic optimization using reinforcement learning on virtual traffic networks.
This repository houses the codebase for creating and training a machine learning model that leverages traffic simulation data. The goal is to develop a model that can effectively:
  Understand traffic patterns: By analyzing simulated traffic flow, the model will gain insights into vehicle behavior, congestion dynamics,   and potential bottlenecks.
  Predict traffic conditions: The trained model will strive to forecast future traffic states, enabling proactive management and mitigation    of congestion.
  Optimize traffic flow: The model's insights can be used to design and evaluate strategies for optimizing traffic signal timing, route        planning, and infrastructure improvements.
